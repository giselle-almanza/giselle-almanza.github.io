        My name is Giselle Almanza and  I am a second year student who is attending The University of  California, Riverside, and my major is Psychology meaning I am in the department of Psychology. As a full time student trying to get her bachelors degree and juggle multiple tasks while still working as a leasing agent at the Campus Crossing Apartments has taught me to be independent, develop communication skills,develop problem solving skills, and learn to manage my time well. As a leasing agent I learned to be able to develop a strong relationship with my coworkers so we could be a strong group and help each other out if one of us is having a problem. Creating good customer service making sure my clients questions are all answered and making sure they feel that there is a welcoming environment. Being social and friendly and showing them and convincing them to sign their lease with us. Problem solving comes into play when addressing concerns having to know how to quickly find satisfactory solutions. There are lots of times when people will call about someone in their parking spot or something breaking in their unit that needs an instant fix, dealing with these problems helps with quick solving skills. Even though some customers might be wrong or start having an attitude towards me, learning how to speak towards them professionally and stay calm is great when working with certain tenants. Time management takes a huge part into my daily life learning how to manage my classes, homework, and work making sure I use my time wisely so I don't fall behind on school and still be able to deal with work after or before classes. From working as the leasing agent I am trying to gain work experience and even build more my social skills and develop my skills with Microsoft Word and Excel as Excel is a great system to learn as many companies use it to organize data and information. Within the degree I am trying to persuade I will either want to go towards the medical field or teaching. I would want to teach elementary or high school. Working as a leasing agent is teaching me baby steps into building my way up there.  Sometimes having to sacrifice your plans or even sleep to put your priorities first, although at the end all your sacrifices will be worth it in the end and I will be so proud of myself. I am a very dedicated student/worker who loves what she does and she is not afraid of always trying something new. Therefore these work and school related skills enhance my ability of performance as a leasing agent and student trying to pursue a degree as well. Also, this is my only job and form of work experience when it comes to a job. I believe that its an amazing opportunity, especially for a first job and it can help with learning lots of great work and personal use type of skills.
